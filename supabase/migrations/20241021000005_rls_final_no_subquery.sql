-- Policy 1: Authenticated users can read ALL memberships
-- This is safe - memberships are not sensitive data
-- The actual household data is protected by other RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "read_all_memberships"
  ON household_members FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Policy 2: Allow INSERT only through application logic
-- We'll handle this in the application with proper checks
CREATE POLICY "insert_memberships"
  ON household_members FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);  -- Application will validate

-- Policy 3: Users can only delete their OWN membership
CREATE POLICY "delete_own_membership"
  ON household_members FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Policy 4: Allow service role to do anything (for admin operations)
CREATE POLICY "service_role_all"
  ON household_members FOR ALL
  TO service_role
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
