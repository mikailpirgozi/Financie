# ‚úÖ Migration Status - Loan Performance Optimization

**Date:** October 30, 2024  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED**

---

## üìä Migration Details

### File
- `supabase/migrations/20241030_optimize_loans_performance.sql`

### Changes Applied

#### 1. Database Indexes ‚úÖ
- `idx_loan_schedules_composite` - Composite index on (loan_id, status, due_date)
- `idx_loan_schedules_status` - Index on (loan_id, status)
- `idx_loans_household_status` - Index on (household_id, status)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Applied (or already existed)

#### 2. Materialized View ‚úÖ
- `loan_metrics` - Pre-calculated aggregations for instant queries
  - Installment counts (paid, overdue, pending, due_soon)
  - Financial metrics (remaining, paid, interest, fees)
  - Current balance and next installment info
  - Auto-refresh on any loan_schedules/loans changes

**Status:** ‚úÖ Applied

#### 3. Triggers ‚úÖ
- `trigger_refresh_loan_metrics` - Auto-refresh on loan_schedules changes
- `trigger_refresh_loan_metrics_loans` - Auto-refresh on loans changes
- Function: `refresh_loan_metrics()` - Refreshes materialized view

**Status:** ‚úÖ Applied (or already existed)

## üîç Verification Queries

### Check Indexes
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename IN ('loans', 'loan_schedules') 
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_loan%'
ORDER BY indexname;
```

### Check Materialized View
```sql
SELECT schemaname, matviewname 
FROM pg_matviews 
WHERE matviewname = 'loan_metrics';
```

### Check Triggers
```sql
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, event_object_table 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name LIKE 'trigger_refresh%';
```

### Test Materialized View
```sql
SELECT * FROM loan_metrics LIMIT 5;
```

## üìà Expected Performance Impact

After migration:
- Query performance: 500-1000ms ‚Üí **50-100ms** (10√ó faster)
- API response time: <100ms
- Table scroll: 60 FPS
- Initial load: <1s

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **First Initial Load:** The first time you load the loan detail page, materialized view will calculate all aggregations. This may take a few seconds on large datasets (360+ installments).

2. **Refresh Behavior:** After any payment, schedule change, or other mutation, the materialized view refreshes automatically (via trigger).

3. **Concurrent Refresh:** Views use `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY` to avoid locking.

4. **No Data Loss:** This migration only adds indexes and views - no existing data is modified or deleted.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Migration applied to Supabase
2. ‚è≥ Run testing checklist (see TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)
3. ‚è≥ Verify performance improvements
4. ‚è≥ Monitor for 24h after deployment
5. ‚è≥ Deploy to production when confirmed

## üìù Rollback (if needed)

If issues occur:

```bash
# Revert the commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# OR manual Supabase rollback
# Dashboard > Backups > Restore from before migration
```

SQL to remove migration manually:
```sql
-- Remove triggers
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_refresh_loan_metrics ON loan_schedules;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_refresh_loan_metrics_loans ON loans;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS refresh_loan_metrics();

-- Remove materialized view
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS loan_metrics;

-- Drop indexes (optional)
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_loan_schedules_composite;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_loan_schedules_status;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_loans_household_status;
```
