# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Loan Performance Optimization

**Status:** ✅ Ready for Production  
**Build Status:** ✅ Passed  
**Tests:** ✅ All checks pass  

---

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# Apply migration to Supabase
supabase db push

# Verify materialized view created:
# SELECT * FROM loan_metrics LIMIT 1;

# Verify indexes exist:
# SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'loan_schedules';
```

**Expected outcome:**
- 3 indexes created (loan_schedules_composite, loan_schedules_status, loans_household_status)
- Materialized view `loan_metrics` created
- Triggers for auto-refresh installed

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these exist in production `.env`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
```

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
# Local build test (already passed)
pnpm build
✓ Build successful

# TypeScript check
pnpm typecheck
✓ No errors

# Linting
pnpm lint
✓ No warnings
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Push to main branch
git push origin main

# Vercel auto-deploys
# Monitor: https://vercel.com/dashboard/deployments

# Check preview deployment first (automatic)
# Test on preview URL before production
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build
pnpm build

# Deploy to your infrastructure
# (Docker, Railway, Render, etc.)
```

---

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. API Endpoints Test
```bash
# Test pagination endpoint
curl "https://your-app.com/api/loans/[loan-id]/schedule?page=1&limit=50"

# Test metrics endpoint
curl "https://your-app.com/api/loans/[loan-id]/metrics"

# Expected: <100ms response time
```

### 2. React Query DevTools
- Open app in development
- Check DevTools (bottom-right)
- Verify cache keys: `loan-schedule`, `loan-metrics`
- Verify mutations work

### 3. Performance Monitoring
**Supabase Dashboard:**
- Check query performance
- Monitor materialized view refresh time

**Vercel Analytics:**
- Check Core Web Vitals
- Monitor LCP < 2.5s
- Monitor CLS < 0.1

### 4. Error Monitoring
- Set up Sentry (optional but recommended)
- Monitor error rates for 24h
- Check for any unexpected errors

## 📊 Expected Performance

| Metric | Expected | Actual |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Initial Load | <1s | ? |
| API Response | <100ms | ? |
| Table Scroll | 60 FPS | ? |
| Memory | <100MB | ? |

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

```bash
# Revert latest commit
git revert HEAD

# Or reset to previous state
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```

**Database rollback (Supabase):**
1. Go to Dashboard > Backups
2. Restore from backup before migration
